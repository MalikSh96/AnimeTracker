ASP.NET is an open source, server-side web application framework created by Microsoft that runs on Windows.

High speed, low cost, and vast language support are among the most significant benefits. 
ASP.NET is built into the familiar Windows server environment, requiring less setup and 
configuration than other web development platforms that must be installed and configured separately.

As a whole, ASP.NET is a great framework to use when developing web sites and web applications. 
It is reliable, fast, easy to use, free and widely known. 
ASP.NET gives you full control of your development and can be used on any project, big or small
